```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

**Important:** Type this code yourself - don't copy and paste! This helps you learn.

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Install Java Extensions in Cursor

Cursor needs some extra tools to work with Java. Let's install them!

### 4a. Install Java Extension Pack

1. In Cursor, click the Extensions icon on the left sidebar (looks like four squares)
2. In the search box, type "Extension Pack for Java"
3. Look for the one by vscjava (it should be the first result)
4. Click "Install"
5. Wait for it to finish installing

**What this gives you:**

- Java language support
- Code completion and error checking
- Run and debug buttons
- Project management tools

### 4b. Install Additional Java Tools

After the Extension Pack installs, Cursor might ask you to install additional Java tools:

1. If you see a popup asking to install Java tools, click "Install"
2. Wait for all installations to complete
3. You might need to restart Cursor

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Run Your Program!

Now let's make your program actually work! With the Java extensions installed, you'll have run buttons.

### 5a. Check Your Code

First, make sure your HelloWorld.java file looks exactly like this:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

**Important:** Check that:

- You have the `.java` extension on your filename
- There are no extra spaces or typos
- All the brackets `{` and `}` match up

### 5b. Run Your Program

1. Look for a small "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) above your code or in the top-right corner
2. Click on it, or press `F5`
3. Cursor will compile and run your Java program automatically

**What happens:** The Java extension will compile your code and show the output!

**If the play button doesn't work:**

1. **Check the bottom status bar** - Look for any error messages in red
2. **Try restarting Cursor** - Close and reopen Cursor completely
3. **Check Java installation** - Make sure Java is properly installed (Step 3)
4. **Verify file extension** - Your file must end with `.java`
5. **Ask for help** - If nothing works, raise your hand and ask your instructor!

**Alternative way to run:**
If the button still doesn't work, you can also:

1. Right-click anywhere in your HelloWorld.java file
2. Look for "Run Java" in the context menu
3. Click on it to run your program

### 5c. See Your Results

If everything works correctly, you should see:

- A new panel at the bottom of Cursor called "Output" or "Terminal"
- The words "Hello, world!" displayed (after a complicated-looking command)

**Congratulations!** You just wrote and ran your first Java program! üéâ

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Add Course Rules to Your Project

Your instructor has provided special rules for using Cursor's AI features. These rules help you learn programming with best practices for styling, growth mindset messaging, and more!

### 6a. Create the Rules Folder

1. In Cursor, right-click on your "labone" folder in the left sidebar
2. Select "New Folder"
3. Name it `.cursor` (include the dot at the beginning)
4. Press Enter

### 6b. Create the Rules Subfolder

1. Right-click on the `.cursor` folder you just created
2. Select "New Folder"
3. Name it `rules`
4. Press Enter

### 6c. Copy the Rules File

1. In GitHub, at the top-ish section of the page, there is a file called `cs1cursor.md`. Copy the contents of that file.
2. Right-click on the `rules` folder
3. Select "New File"
4. Name it `cs1cursor.md`
5. Copy and paste the content your instructor provided into this file
6. Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

**Your project structure should now look like this:**

```
labone/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cursor/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cs1cursor.md
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HelloWorld.java
```

**What this does:** These rules tell Cursor's AI how to help you learn programming step by step, without just giving you complete solutions!

## ‚úÖ Step 7: Use Cursor's AI to Enhance Your Program

Now let's see how Cursor's AI can help you learn programming! We'll use it to add some cool features to your Hello World program.

### 7a. Open the AI Chat Panel

1. Look for the AI Chat icon on the left sidebar (looks like a chat bubble or message icon)
2. Click on it to open the AI chat panel
3. You should see a chat interface where you can talk to Cursor's AI

### 7b. Ask the AI for Help

Let's give your program a fun goal! We want it to:

1. Print "Hello, world!" (you already have this!)
2. Print your name
3. Print a celebratory cheer

Start by asking the AI:

```
"I want my program to print my name after 'Hello, world!'. What do I need to learn to do this?"
```

**What to expect:** The AI will:

- Explain programming concepts in simple terms
- Give you small examples to understand
- Guide you through learning one concept at a time
- Ask you to explain what you understand before moving forward

**For beginners:** Don't ask for complete solutions! Ask for explanations of concepts first.

### 7c. Learn Step by Step

1. **Start with printing your name** - Ask "How do I make my program print my name?"
2. **Ask for small examples** - "Can you show me a simple example of this?"
3. **Explain back** - Tell the AI what you think you understand
4. **Build gradually** - Add one feature at a time

**What you'll see:** The AI will explain concepts, show tiny code examples (5 lines or less), and help you understand before creating any code that you can apply to your own work.

**Your learning path:**

- First: Learn how to print your name (variables)
- Then: Learn how to add a celebratory cheer
- Finally: Have a program that does three things in sequence!

**Remember:** It's okay to not know everything! The AI is here to teach you step by step. We'll build this together!
